It uses the pressure of confined photons, the quantum-mechanical particles of light, to manipulate the properties of mechanical objects ranging from the nanoscale to the macroscale.\r\n\r\nRecent experiments have, for example, demonstrated how laser cooling – a technique initially invented to cool clouds of atoms – can be used to curb the vibrations of small mechanical devices. This opens up the fascinating prospect of mechanical resonators operating at the frigid temperatures where quantum effects come into play.\r\n\r\nSuch quantum resonators would have applications in sensing, metrology and quantum information processing, but what I find most intriguing is the possibility that an object visible to the naked eye can be put into a quantum superposition between two separated locations – so it is both here and there. Testing the predictions of quantum theory in a completely new regime of size and mass will bring fresh insights into where the boundary between the classical and the quantum worlds lies – and perhaps even to the great unfinished business of unifying quantum physics and gravity.

Nanocoatings can be applied to an object to dramatically improve functionality – for example, hydrophobic glass upon which raindrops bounce straight off; slippery, hydrophilic medical devices that can be inserted with minimal discomfort; or coatings with highly-antibacterial properties. These specialised coatings are often applied through harsh processes during manufacturing, making it difficult to reapply them to finished products, also limiting what materials can be used in the process. To overcome these limitations, a team of academics from Australia have developed several new methods to apply nanocoating films. In one of these techniques, flexible, multi-layered nano-films can be built and then transferred using a high-strength adhesive layer. Another technique from the same researchers allows a nanocoating to be applied to any surface in a series of two quick spray-on coats. These new coatings enable greater flexibility, easy removal and reapplication.\r\n",

    "content" : "From 1780 to 1834, telescope maker William Herschel and his sister Caroline systematically mapped the heavens, charting thousands of stars and nebulae in the process. He also discovered Uranus, and if astronomers had stuck with his proposed name of Georgium Sidus (George’s Star) we would have been saved centuries of terrible jokes. Making a map barely counts as a discovery; yet Herschel’s was extremely important, because when it was all finished it revealed the shape and size of the Milky Way galaxy. Not only was it much, much larger than had previously been estimated, but it turned out to be disc shaped, and our own sun was located nowhere near the centre. Herschel’s work cleared up a lot of misconceptions about our own little corner of the universe.",

This renders biology more user-friendly, as it eliminates the need for microbial culturing, training, and equipment. They’ve been around in research labs for a while. Making cell-free systems available to all could kick off a new era of “decellularized” do-it-yourself biology. How does it work? You’ll get plasmids carrying the genetic software instructions, like an app. They program the ribosome, essentially a 3D protein printer, to produce different proteins. They could be custom fluorescent colors, vanilla smells, or glow-in-the-dark ink to begin with. ",

    "content" : "MIT scientists at MIT have discovered a previously unknown phenomenon that can cause powerful waves of energy to shoot through minuscule wires known as carbon nanotubes. The discovery could lead to a new way of producing electricity.The phenomenon, described as thermopower waves, “opens up a new area of energy research, which is rare,” says Michael Strano, MIT’s Charles and Hilda Roddey Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering.In the new experiments conducted by Michael Strano and his team, nanotubes were coated with a layer of a reactive fuel that can produce heat by decomposing. This fuel was then ignited at one end of the nanotube using either a laser beam or a high-voltage spark, and the result was a fast-moving thermal wave traveling along the length of the carbon nanotube like a flame speeding along the length of a lit fuse. The heat from the fuel goes into the nanotube, where it travels thousands of times faster than in the fuel itself. As the heat feeds back to the fuel coating, a thermal wave is created that is guided along the nanotube. With a temperature of 3,000 kelvins, this ring of heat speeds along the tube 10,000 times faster than the normal spread of this chemical reaction. The heating produced by that combustion, it turns out, also pushes electrons along the tube, creating a substantial electrical current.",

    "content" : "The accelerating expansion of the universe is the observation that the expansion of the universe is such that the velocity at which a distant galaxy is receding from the observer is continuously increasing with time. The accelerated expansion was discovered during 1998, by two independent projects, the Supernova Cosmology Project and the High-Z Supernova Search Team, which both used distant type Ia supernovae to measure the acceleration. The idea was that as type Ia supernovae have almost the same intrinsic brightness (a standard candle), and since objects that are further away appear dimmer, we can use the observed brightness of these supernovae to measure the distance to them. The distance can then be compared to the supernovae's cosmological redshift, which measures how much the universe has expanded since the supernova occurred. The unexpected result was that objects in the universe are moving away from one another at an accelerated rate. Cosmologists at the time expected that recession velocity would always be decelerating, due to the gravitational attraction of the matter in the universe. Three members of these two groups have subsequently been awarded Nobel Prizes for their discovery. The accelerated expansion of the universe is thought to have begun since the universe entered its dark-energy-dominated era roughly 4 billion years ago . ",

Standard dialysis involves three long sessions at a hospital per week. But an artificial kidney developed by Los Angeles-based Xcorporeal can clean blood around the clock. The machine is fully automated, battery-operated, waterproof and, at less than 5 pounds, portable. Wearable and portable dialysis devices could potentially improve patient quality of life by allowing patients to continue with their daily activities of life while undergoing dialysis, as well as by loosening—or removing entirely—dietary and fluid restrictions and reducing pill burden. We are therefore potentially at a new dawn in the treatment of dialysis patients with the first generation of wearable and portable dialysis devices, which may well revolutionise the treatment and quality of life for patients with end-stage kidney disease.",

    "content" : "Catherine Hockmuth of UC San Diego reports that a new biomaterial designed for repairing damaged human tissue doesn't wrinkle when it is stretched. The invention of nano engineers at the University of California, San Diego marks a significant breakthrough in tissue engineering because it more closely mimics the properties of native human tissue. Shaochen Chen, a professor in the Department of NanoEngineering at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering, hopes future tissue patches, which are used to repair damaged heart walls, blood vessels, and skin, for example, will be more compatible than the patches available today. This biofabrication technique uses light, precisely controlled mirrors and a computer projection system to build three-dimensional scaffolds with well-defined patterns of any shape for tissue engineering. Shape turned out to be essential to the new material's mechanical property. While most engineered tissue is layered in scaffolds that take the shape of circular or square holes, Chen's team created two new shapes called \"reentrant honeycomb\" and \"cut missing rib.\" Both shapes exhibit the property of negative Poisson's ratio (i.e. not wrinkling when stretched) and maintain this property whether the tissue patch has one or multiple layers.",

For years, and for all the mounting scientific evidence, black holes have remained marooned in the imaginations of artists and the algorithms of splashy computer models of the kind used in Christopher Nolan's outer-space epic “Interstellar.” Now they are more real than ever. The image, of a lopsided ring of light surrounding a dark circle deep in the heart of a galaxy known as Messier 87, some 55 million light-years away from Earth, resembled the Eye of Sauron, a reminder yet again of the implacable power of nature. It is a smoke ring framing a one-way portal to eternity. To capture the image, astronomers reached across intergalactic space to Messier 87, or M87, a giant galaxy in the constellation Virgo. There, a black hole several billion times more massive than the sun is unleashing a violent jet of energy some 5,000 light-years into space. The image offered a final, ringing affirmation of an idea so disturbing that even Einstein, from whose equations black holes emerged, was loath to accept it.",

In tech we mine bitcoins, but in biology we mine microbes for novel antibiotics! Streptomyces are bacteria that live in the soil, where they produce a variety of antibiotics. The problem is, about 90 percent of biomolecules remain hidden in an inactive part of the microbe’s DNA, so-called silent operons. That is, unless the biosynthesis is activated. And you guessed it, this is where the MicrobeMiner of startup Prospective Research comes into play: it mimics the stimuli present in the soil matrix to launch this machinery. The MicrobeMiner is, at least in part, crowd-sourced. You can order a crowd-sourced drug discovery collection kit, dig around for a sample, and send it in. Your sample microbes are screened to identify these inactive gene clusters. Afterwards, the platform launches a variety of chemical inducers to unlock these pathways. Et voila, here come the novel antibiotics. The team has already identified molecules that turn this “dirt microbe” into a powerful factory.
